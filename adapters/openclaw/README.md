# credence-openclaw

Bayesian **routing and governance** for OpenClaw. One brain, one utility
function, your cost/quality trade-off.

- **`before_model_resolve`** — EU-max model routing: picks the cheapest
  model whose expected accuracy justifies it, learns from outcomes. On by
  default.
- **`before_tool_call`** — in-loop governance: forwards each proposed tool
  call to the credence-openclaw daemon and maps the decision back to OpenClaw:

| brain effector | OpenClaw result |
|---|---|
| `proceed` | allow |
| `block`   | `{ block: true, blockReason }` |
| `ask`     | `{ requireApproval }` — OpenClaw's native approval dialog; the user's choice is posted back so the brain learns |

It also logs tool **outcomes** (`after_tool_call`) and reconstructs
**per-turn cost** (`llm_output` token counts × a price table) so the
observation log accumulates the data the dollars-saved surface needs.

**Fail-open:** if the daemon is unreachable or slow, the tool proceeds
(one warning per outage). Governance never blocks the agent on
infrastructure failure.

This is one of two bodies over the same brain; the other,
`apps/credence-openclaw/extension/`, targets the pi coding agent directly.
Brain + wire (POST `/sensor`, SSE `/signals`) are shared and unchanged.

## Why a plugin (not a pi extension)

Current OpenClaw vendors pi's coding-agent and runs its gateway agent with
`noExtensions: true`, so a pi `ExtensionFactory` never loads. The supported
interception point is an OpenClaw **plugin** `before_tool_call` hook. See
`docs/credence-openclaw-pass-2/move-1-design.md`.

## Install (operator)

1. Start the brain daemon — it listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. Detached +
   restart-resilient: `docker run -d --name credence-openclaw --restart unless-stopped -p
   127.0.0.1:8787:8787 -v ~/.credence-openclaw:/root/.credence-openclaw ghcr.io/gfrmin/credence-openclaw-daemon`
   (or `docker compose -f ../docker-compose.yml up -d`, or from source:
   `julia --project=<repo-root> apps/credence-openclaw/daemon/main.jl`).
   See `apps/credence-openclaw/daemon/README.md`.
2. Build the plugin: `cd apps/credence-openclaw/openclaw-plugin && npm install && npm run build`.
3. Install it into OpenClaw. From a published registry:
   `openclaw plugins install @gfrmin/credence-openclaw`; or link a local
   checkout for development: `openclaw plugins install -l apps/credence-openclaw/openclaw-plugin`.
   Then `openclaw plugins enable credence-openclaw`.
4. **Per-turn cost signal.** On current OpenClaw (≥ 2026.6.2) the `llm_output`
   cost hook is active out of the box — no extra config. (Older builds gated it
   behind a since-removed `plugins.entries.credence-openclaw.hooks.allowConversationAccess`
   flag; that key is now rejected by the config schema.) Governance —
   allow/block/ask — never depended on it.
5. Restart the gateway so it picks up the plugin.
6. Verify it loaded: `openclaw plugins list` shows `credence-openclaw` as `loaded`.

## Config (`openclaw.plugin.json` → `configSchema`)

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `daemonUrl` | `http://127.0.0.1:8787` | credence-openclaw daemon base URL |
| `hookTimeoutMs` | `3000` | max wait for the daemon decision before failing open |
| `approvalTimeoutMs` | `120000` | how long OpenClaw waits for the user on an `ask` before denying |
| `redactToolInputs` | `false` | omit tool-call inputs from sensor events (they can carry secrets); ask-preview becomes generic |
| `shadowMode` | `false` | observe-only: brain decides + daemon logs, body never enforces or overrides the model |
| `routing` | `true` | EU-max **model routing** via `before_model_resolve` — ON by default, roster-aware (see below); set `false` to disable |
| `silent` | `false` | suppress info/warn logs |
| `pricing` | — | per-model USD/Mtok overrides: `{ "<model>": { "input": n, "output": n, "cacheRead": n, "cacheWrite": n } }` |
| `profile` | `"balanced"` | your cost/quality trade-off preset: `cost-saver`, `balanced`, `quality-first`, `speed-first` — sent to the daemon per request, switch any time |
| `profileOverride` | — | advanced: override individual utility dials on top of the preset — keys: `reward`, `lambda`, `q`, `harm`, `w_time`; any subset |

**Privacy:** by default the daemon logs `proposed_call.input` (commands, paths) to
`~/.credence-openclaw/observations.jsonl`. Set `redactToolInputs: true` to keep inputs out of the log.
Fail-open warnings are emitted once per outage (re-armed when the daemon recovers).

The built-in price table is approximate; set `pricing` for an exact
dollars-saved figure for your providers. Unknown/unpriced models log
`usd: null` (token counts still recorded; the Move-2 surface applies a
token×price fallback).

## Model routing (on by default, roster-aware)

The plugin registers a `before_model_resolve` hook that routes each turn to the
EU-max model. It discovers the models OpenClaw actually has — from `api.config`
(the configured providers, their models, and per-Mtok pricing) — posts a
`route-request` carrying that **live roster** plus the prompt's length feature,
and applies the brain's chosen model as OpenClaw's `modelOverride` /
`providerOverride`. The decision is the **same EU-max** the governor runs —
`argmax_a [ value·P(correct|X) − cost_a ]` over the live roster, through the one
canonical `optimise` — so credence-openclaw picks the cheapest model whose expected
accuracy justifies it under the active profile.

| brain effector | OpenClaw result |
|---|---|
| `route` | `{ modelOverride, providerOverride }` from the chosen model |
| (timeout / daemon down / <2 priceable models / undiscoverable roster) | no override — OpenClaw keeps its configured model (fail open) |

**On by default; safe by construction.** Routing is enabled unless you set
`routing: false`. The hook registers only when the plugin discovers **≥2
priceable models** to choose between, so a single-model install (or one whose
models can't be priced) is a silent no-op that keeps OpenClaw's model. With equal
cold priors the EU-max reduces to the **cheapest** model, then learns to escalate
to a pricier one only where it earns its cost — cost-saving from day one, never
mis-routing to a hardcoded default. `shadowMode: true` logs the would-route per
turn without changing the model.

**The per-profile dial** lives in `bdsl/utility.bdsl` (`correct-answer-value`: low
⇒ cost-sensitive, high ⇒ quality-sensitive). The shipped `bdsl/routing.bdsl`
declares a default haiku/sonnet/opus roster used only as a fallback when a request
carries no live roster (an older body); the live roster from `api.config` is what
routing actually uses.

**What the belief is.** Each model's accuracy belief `P(correct | X)` is its own
structure-BMA. Models matching the shipped warm seed
(`brain/routing_brain.counts.json`, distilled from a 3-frontier-model oracle grid)
are **calibrated from install**; the user's **own** models start from a weak prior
and **learn online** — each routed turn's per-turn outcome (did the proposed call
execute cleanly, `tool-completed.success`?) updates the routed model's belief. That
signal is noisy (a correct call can fail on a flaky tool), so the brain models the
confound explicitly and learns it (per-context tool-reliability): a flaky tool is
absorbed by the reliability latent, not blamed on the model. Updates go through the
canonical `condition` (mean-exact, so routing's EU is exact); a human
approve/reject is the gold anchor. Per-call **cost** comes from the user's config
pricing (output-$/Mtok × a shared per-call token scale; a learned per-model
`E[tokens/call]` is a follow-up). Honest limits — per-turn proxy ≠ ground-truth
correctness; false-success is weakly identified; run-level credit assignment is
deferred — are in `eval/results/ROUTING_DOMINANCE.md`. The belief is durable
(route-outcomes are logged and replayed on restart). Routing currently conditions
on `prompt-length` (the one feature honestly extractable from a raw prompt); the
structure-BMA collapses it to the marginal if it doesn't predict accuracy. Richer
covariates are a follow-up.

## Develop

```
npm install
npm run build      # tsc → dist/
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm test           # node --test (tsx) over tests/*.test.ts
```

## Architecture (server-side extraction)

Feature & taint extraction is **server-side**, single-sourced in the governor core
(`packages/governor_core`, Python). This adapter carries **no** feature or safety
logic: `session.ts` maintains a per-run **message buffer** (tool calls + results) and
posts the harness-neutral `{tool_name, input, session:{cwd, project_root, messages}}`;
the daemon extracts. This is the same neutral shape the Claude Code adapter builds from
its transcript — one extractor, every harness (DRY). Routing's `prompt-length` feature
is the one exception that stays client-side (it has no cross-harness analogue).

## Known limitations (Move 1 / MVP-0)

- `working-directory-relative` and `time-since-last-user-message` are best-effort
  (OpenClaw doesn't put a cwd or message timestamps on the tool ctx — cwd is mapped
  from the tool's first derived path, and there is no user-message hook to stamp);
  the loop-relevant features (tool-name, parent, repetition) are exact.
- `redactToolInputs` blanks the tool input in the human-facing **ask-text preview**
  and keeps it out of the observation log (which stores only derived feature buckets);
  the real input still reaches the local daemon transiently for extraction (you cannot
  detect identical-call loops without seeing the args).
- Cost USD is reconstructed from a local price table (no host `calculateCost`
  dependency); override via `pricing`.
- The per-run message buffer is bounded per run but the run map is not evicted on a
  long-lived gateway — a cleanup item.
